TESTING CONNECTION TO NEW GITHUB USERNAMER

## Intro

#### Background

The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) is an independent agency of the federal government on a mission to, "advance, support, and empower America's museums libraries, and related organizations through grantmaking, research, and policy development."

The IMLS maintains a list of museums in the US in a set of files called the Museum Data Files (MDF). The MDF contain basic institutional identifying information for about 30,000 museums and related organizations in the US. They are split into three files using the following categories. The MDF was last updated in 2018.

The IMLS also makes available data regarding the grants they award to these institutions for various initiatives.

#### Project Goal

Use data from the IMLS to explore how grants are distributed across disciplines, areas, and time.

<br>

## Analysis

For this project I'm going to use the following packages.


```r
library(tidyverse)
library(leaflet)
```

<br>

The next step is to import the data into RStudio. The first file is File 1 from the MDF that I downloaded from the IMLS website. I'm only going to use File 1 because all of the institutions are categorized as one of seven disciplines:

1.  Art Museums

2.  Arboretums, Botanical Gardens, & Nature Centers

3.  Children's Museums

4.  History Museums

5.  Natural History & Natural Science Museums

6.  Science & Technology Museums & Planetariums

7.  Zoos, Aquariums, & Wildlife Conservation

File 2 contains "uncategorized or general museums" and File 3 is "historical societies, historic preservation". The discipline variable will be another way to analyze the grant data.


```r
# import MDF File 1 (v2), format select columns
data_museums_raw <- read_csv("MuseumFile2018_File1_Nulls v2.csv", 
                             col_types = cols(DISCIPL = col_factor(levels = c("ART", "BOT", 
                                                                              "CMU", "HST", 
                                                                              "NAT", "SCI", 
                                                                              "ZAW")), 
                                              TAXPER15 = col_date(format = "%Y%m"),
                                              INCOMECD15 = col_factor(levels = c("0", "1", 
                                                                                 "2", "3", 
                                                                                 "4", "5", 
                                                                                 "6", "7",
                                                                                 "8", "9")),
                                              AAMREG = col_factor(levels = c("1", "2", "3",
                                                                             "4", "5", "6")),
                                              BEAREG = col_factor(levels = c("1", "2", "3",
                                                                             "4", "5", "6",
                                                                             "7", "8")),
                                              LOCALE4 = col_factor(levels = c("1", "2", "3", 
                                                                              "4"))
                                              )
                             )

# select columns to work with
data_museums <- data_museums_raw %>%
  select(COMMONNAME,
         LEGALNAME,
         ADCITY,
         ADSTATE,
         LONGITUDE,
         LATITUDE,
         DISCIPL,
         AAMREG,
         BEAREG,
         LOCALE4,
         TAXPER15,
         INCOMECD15,
         INCOME15,
         REVENUE15,
         MID
         )
```

<br>

The second file contains data on all grants awarded to museums by the IMLS.


```r
# import grant data (v2)
data_grants_raw <- read_csv("awarded-grants-2023-04-01 v2.csv")

# select columns to work with
data_grants <- data_grants_raw %>%
  select(institution,
         city,
         state,
         year,
         funds,
         `log number`
         )
```

<br>

In order to breakdown the grant data by multiple criteria I need to join the two files together into one dataset.


```r
# join requires the same case for character strings
data_museums$COMMONNAME <- tolower(data_museums$COMMONNAME)
data_grants$institution <- tolower(data_grants$institution)

# join by name
data_joined <- data_museums %>%
  full_join(data_grants, 
            by = c("COMMONNAME" = "institution"), 
            keep = TRUE,
            relationship = "many-to-many"
            )
```

<br>

What matched?


```r
data_joined %>%
  filter(!is.na(COMMONNAME),
         !is.na(funds)
         ) %>%
  group_by(institution) %>%
  summarize(grants = n(),
            funds = sum(funds)
            ) %>%
  summarise(total_grants = sum(grants),
            total_funds = sum(funds)
            )
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 2
##   total_grants total_funds
##          <int>       <dbl>
## 1         2354   266302369
```

<br>

-   Number of grants = 2,354

-   Value of grants = \$266M

<br>

What didn't match?


```r
data_joined %>%
  filter(is.na(COMMONNAME)) %>%
  group_by(institution) %>%
  summarize(grants = n(),
            funds = sum(funds)
            ) %>%
  summarise(total_grants = sum(grants),
            total_funds = sum(funds)
            )
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 2
##   total_grants total_funds
##          <int>       <dbl>
## 1         8213   700932592
```

<br>

-   Number of grants = 8,213

-   Value of grants = \$701M

<br>

A grant may not match with an institution for several reasons:

1.  The awarded institution is not in File 1 because it's in File 2 or File 3

2.  Character strings are different (extra "the", & or and, spelling, etc)

3.  The awarded institution is not in the MDF because it was established after 2015

<br>

I suspect that #1 is the largest contributing factor. File 1 contains 7,429 entries while File 2 and 3 contain 22,742 together.

### Part 1

Overview of institutions.


```r
# create a palette that maps museum discipline to colors
pal1 <- colorFactor(c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green3", "deepskyblue2", "blue4", "purple4"),
                   domain = c("ART", "BOT", "CMU", "HST", "NAT", "SCI", "ZAW")
                   )

# create map with common name as label and colored by discipline
leaflet(data_museums) %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.TonerLite, group = "Lite") %>%
  #addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.Terrain, group = "Terrain") %>%
  #addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.WorldImagery, group = "World Imagery") %>%
  #addLayersControl(baseGroups = c("Lite", "Terrain")) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(label = ~COMMONNAME,
                   fillColor = ~pal1(DISCIPL),
                   fillOpacity = 0.6,
                   stroke = TRUE,
                   color = "black",
                   weight = 1,
                   radius = 2) #%>%
